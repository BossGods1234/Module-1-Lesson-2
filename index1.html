        <b>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular
        court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter)
        through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at
        each end of the court), while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth
        two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the
        player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with
        the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of
        play (overtime) is mandated.</b>
