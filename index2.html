<h1>About Giannis</h1>
<b><i><p>Early life</i></b>
    <hr>
<p>As the son of immigrants from Nigeria,<sup>[13][14][15]</sup> Giannis Sina Ugo Adetokunbo<sup>[16][17]</sup> was born in Athens, Greece, on
December 6, 1994.<sup>[18]</sup> His father was a soccer player and his mother was a high jumper in Nigeria. Three years earlier,
they had moved from Lagos, leaving their firstborn son, Francis, under the care of his grandparents.<sup>[19]</sup> Adetokunbo grew
up in the Athens neighborhood of Sepolia<sup>[15]</sup> in a primarily Nigerian household.<sup>[20]</sup> His parents, as immigrants without
work permits,<sup>[21]</sup> could not easily find work, so Giannis and his older brother Thanasis helped by hawking watches,
handbags, and sunglasses in the streets.<sup>[22]</sup> In 2007, Adetokunbo started playing basketball.<sup>[23]</sup></p></p>

<i><p>During the 2012â€“13 Greek A2 League season, Antetokounmpo shot 46.4% from the field (62.1% on two-point field goals),
31.3% from three-point range, and 72.0% from the free throw line, while averaging 22.5 minutes per game. Over 26 games,
he averaged 9.5 points, 5.0 rebounds, 1.4 assists, and 1.0 blocks per game.[35] He was also selected by the coaches as a
special participant in the 2013 Greek League All-Star Game. Even though he was not selected as an all-star, the coaches</i>
<mark>let him play in the game as a treat for the fans, since he was in attendance at the game.[36] However, he did not get
officially counted as an all-star selection, since only players that play in Greece's first division are even eligible
to actually be voted to play in the game, and Antetokounmpo was playing in Greece's second division at the time.</p></mark>
